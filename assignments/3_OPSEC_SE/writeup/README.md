## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

I would send her a phishing email posing as her bank. I would say that she needs to set up or update her security questions and ask her to use her PIN as identification. I would make the security questions all the questions that I want to know. This website could also serve to detect which browser she is using. 

### Part 2 (60 pts)

1. Use a less public user name and a stronger password. This would make it significantly harder to guess a correct combination. The password should be longer and less common with special characters.

2. Add something like fail2ban to the server. This would prevent brute force attacks by making the time required to guess the right password significantly longer.

3. Put your secret directories behind a password and don’t just rely on security through obscurity. Or if they don’t need to be accessed regularly just make them unavailable on the web server.
