### Part 2 (75 pts)

You should tell your boss as soon as possible. It should only be made public once you are sure that there is no danger involved in doing so. This would allow other companies to avoid making the same mistake without endangering any current users. If you are aware that other companies have units in production that have similar flaws you should tell them privately and potetially offer your solution if you have one. If your company is unwilling to postpone the release then it is necessary to make the dangers of the insecurity public but not the specifics of the exploit. A consumer watchdog could be helpful with this. This would help force the company to fix the problem while warning the consumers while protecing the affected units that are currently in use. As long as you tell your boss, you are not fully responsible. Failing to tell anybody will result in you deserving one hundred percent of the blame if anything goes wrong. If you do nothing you would be at least partially responsible because you could have prevented any harm. However it is still mostly the fault of whoever made the decision not to address the insecurity right away.
